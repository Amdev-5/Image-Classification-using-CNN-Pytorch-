# Image-Classification-using-CNN-Pytorch

In this notebook,  CIFAR10 Dataset has been explored and image Classification has been done using Convoulation Neural Network.
Libraries used are Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib.
Framework used is Pytorch
Further after training and testing, Overfitting found in the model, using more counvoulation layers model has been improved.
